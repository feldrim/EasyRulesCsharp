# EasyRulesCsharp
C# implementation of EasyRules ( http://www.easyrules.org )

Let's do it step by step.

    [ ] Write all classes exact the same way, but in C#.
    
    [ ] Use FluentScheduler (https://github.com/fluentscheduler/FluentScheduler) instead of Quartz.
    
    [ ] Refactor it for C#.
    
    [ ] Get the rules out of code.
    
    [ ] Code a console application for testing.
